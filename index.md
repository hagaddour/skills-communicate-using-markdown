# testing and learning about headings

```js
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
   return foo + ':' + s;
}
```
```py
foo = 'bar'

Caz(s):
   return foo + ':' + s
```
## practice makes perfect
just need to be able to practice
### one step at a time while building up clearer picture of the goal is one way to do
sometimes the first step is the hardest
Neat picture

#### another is to have good steps to follow and the results will take care of themselves
but how can one come up with those steps

##### there is also situations when it's difficult to know what you don't know
***way to figure out what u don't know what u don't know***
- [ ] define the problem/end goal/where you need to be as specifically as possible
- [ ] see if there are foundational resources that will help with improving overall understanding of the situation
- [ ] try to see some similarities in other *context* to see what can help in your situation
- [x] overall need to **something** to get the result needed (it always help if it can be broken down)
- [ ] then see what the results after trying/doing the something and hopefully they're the expected results
